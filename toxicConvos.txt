Obama ran on those issues and won because the Republican party didnt pay attention to the changing zeitgeist.

The statistics certainly indicate that there is.  Im saying that issues like that simply arent important enough to sway the overall vote right now.  Maybe in another four to eight years when more important things are handled those issues will hold more sway.  They just dont now.  70 of Americans may think pot should be legal but they dont think pot should be legal at the cost of electing say a libertarian for President when the rests of his policies are abhorrent to them.  I genuinely think we fool ourselves daily in this sub when we complain just as an example about candidates like Gary Johnson not getting any tangible voting percentage because the system is rigged.  The system may very well be rigged but Gary Johnson didnt get any tangible voting percentage because libertarianism is scary to about 95 of voters.  They arent blocked from access to learning about that ideology.  Most of them are perfectly aware of libertarianism and it sounds like a disaster waiting to happen to them.      The point is this  people in the larger reddit political groups whether it be the socialists and progressives or the libertarians and anarchocapitalists would do well to remind themselves on a daily basis that as much as you hate and look down on the more standard moderate Democrats conservative Republicans and moderate Independents they still make up a much larger and more powerful voting bloc than we do and as such they are not only going to get their way in the voting most of the time but they are actually entitled to having their way more often.  That is how democracy works.    Or to put it more succinctly you dont have to like that the majority of the population is okay with drone strikes and that theyd rather focus on pot legalization later on down the road but you do have to remember that those people live in the same country as you do and they have the same rights to representation and policy making as you do and when they outnumber you they are going to get what they want more than you.     I get what we all want here.  We want to see American jingoism come to an end and we want to see a social safety net that makes sense and protects the vulnerable without exploiting the tax payers.  We want to see the economy grow and prosper we want the government to do its job but not OVERDO its job.  We all define those goals differently though.  If you think the majority opinion right now is wrong thats fine and you can do something about it by finding ways to engage the mainstream in meaningful and civil discourse and presenting alternative views in a way that inspires and encourages selfreflection on a given position.  But for the record youre not accomplishing anything by referring to a majorityelected President with a mandate as a corrupt piece of garbage.  Remember that in a room of 100 people 51 of them voted for him and the other 49 voted for a guy you also just called a corrupt piece of garbage by proxy.

If on the other hand you find ways to express to those people that not only do you respect their right to disagree with you but you understand their motivations for doing so you will be much more likely to find closed mouths and open ears when you have the opportunity to share you opposing beliefs.    Frankly I dont see us getting any of these things fixed in this Presidency or the next and it has nothing to do with Obama.

When Bush 2 was late in his first term the zeitgeist was national security above everything else combined.  He was viewed as having succeeded in that area and that is why he got reelected.  By the time Obama was running the zeitgeist had changed to focusing on some specific civil liberties.  Gay rights but not legal pot.  Fairness in taxes but not ending warrantless wiretapping.  Obama ran on those issues and won because the Republican party didnt pay attention to the changing zeitgeist.

Downvote if you must but at least give your reasons for doing so.  Id like to hear alternate opinions and maybe itll help me change my mindset.The real price of our freedom is that some people will misuse it.  For instance...The first amendment allows for freedom of speech so we can speak out against things we dont like about government or any other aspect of society.  Unfortunately that also means that groups like the Westboro Baptist Church or KKK can legally spew their hate speech and are fully protected by the law.The fourth amendment protects citizens unlawful search and seizure from law enforcementgovernment.  This prevents them from being able to enter a home or search a random person and take things without a warrant or probable cause. This has also has prohibited police from entering the home of a known drug dealer or domestic abuser because there was no warrant or 911 call.The fifth amendment protects the accused from incriminating themselves or providing testimony that would lead to their prosecution or possible conviction. Unfortunately this also also means that actual criminals are sometimes able to escape justice because courts arent always able to provide necessary evidence without that specific testimony.And the 2nd amendment means that private citizens are allowed to own firearms to protect themselves from criminals and enemies foreigndomestic.

Because of the problem of confirmation bias we naturally place a great degree of significance on people drawing conclusions that are not consistent with their previous world view or peer groups world view. Thats why we find it noteworthy when a GOP senator supports gay marriage for example. When someone changes their mind on something or expresses a view thats not typical of their peer group its noteworthy because such rare events are usually a result of extraordinary thought or evidence.

This is why they included the language about a militia because the militia was all able bodied men under a certain age which could be called upon to deal with an out of control federal government and its army.  The militia laws still exist and if you are an able bodied adult under the age of 60 you are the militia.  So if you want freedom which apparently many people dont then you need to man up and be prepared to do your duty arm yourself and be prepared to resist any tyranny that might come from the federal government and the army it controls.

[('t1_c81lg94', 'AsABlackMan', '1358881513', 'Edit So I guess its not as unpopular as I thought it would be gtgt  Thank you for the reddit goldFor those of you who want a TLDR Im really sorry. Campaign finance requires a bit of background on First Amendment law and the relevant case history. This massive wall of text is the best I could do to condense such a huge topic. You have my deepest apologies for that. You can glean the important bits because theyll be in bold like this. Warning  really somewhat unpopular view of Citizens United aheadHonestly I think this is just populist pandering by the congressman and his staff.Its a little disingenuous for an elected official to give credence to the idea that Citizens United creates corporate personhood out of nothing. Instead of actually trying to explain the complexity of the intersection between free speech and the fear of corruption the congressman is just playing us for political popularity points.The main rule with the First Amendment is that speech and the press may not be restricted unless theres a compelling government interest and that restriction is narrowly tailored to that interest. With that in mind lets plow on ahead.So heres what Citizens United is and isnt about in generalCitizens United isnt about corporate personhood Corporate personhood is utterly separate from the First Amendment. Corporations are juridical persons because 1 thats how they own property 2 thats how they get sued in court and 3 thats how we attach liability to them. Corporate personhood is just a neat legal fiction that has no First Amendment implications. Treating a corporation like a person is just a way to be able to attach duties and liabilities to a corporation. Corporations get due process rights not because of personhood but because due process is a structural protection. Its how our government is designed to act whenever it wants to take life liberty or property. If it helps think of due process as a limit on the state rather than an affirmative right given topossessed by individuals.  The same thing goes for the right to free speech. The First Amendment is a restriction on government action not an affirmative grant of a right. The right to free speech doesnt come from personhood it comes from Congress constitutional inability to abridge freedom of speech. The Framers realized that neutering the governments ability to act was a stronger protection than granting an affirmative right to the people. Thats why the First Amendment starts with Congress shall make no law rather than The people have a right to free speech. The distinction is subtle but it makes all the difference in the world.  The issue in Citizens United was really narrow. It was whether the statute that prohibited advocacy electioneering by thirdparty organizations 3060 days before an election infringed on free speech. The Supreme Court rightly I think found that it did.  All Citizens United does is recognize we have a really strong right to free speech in the United States that can only be restricted when theres a compelling interest and that the restriction is narrowly tailored to that interest. The 3060 day electioneering ban on thirdparty groups didnt fit the bill of being narrowly tailored to a compelling interest so it went out the door.Money is not and never has been pure speech. We also already regulate it Assume youre a person with a lot of money and you want to give a lot of it to your favorite candidate. Because of Buckley v. Valeo you cant give an unlimited amount of money directly to a candidate you like. Buckley recognized that theres a compelling interest in making sure candidates cant be swayed by big individual donors and upheld disclosure requirements as well as campaign contribution limits to candidates. Citizens United didnt change this. Its still illegal for an individual a company or any organization to give an unlimited amount of money to a candidate directly. Money is not and never has been pure speech under the complete protection of the First Amendment. If money was totally protected by the First Amendment antibribery laws couldnt exist because restricting bribes would be an abridgment of the right to free speech.  Money while not pure speech still falls under First Amendment protection. The reason we can regulate money though is because theres a a compelling interest  the fear of corruption or the appearance of corruption. This is why the Buckley court upheld campaign contribution limits to individual candidates and why the Citizens United court upheld mandatory disclosure provisions for PACs. These restrictions on free speech were narrowly tailored to the compelling interest of eliminating or avoiding corruption.  The Buckley corruption reasoning is also the implicit exception to Citizens United. The anticorruption rationale is enough to restrict individual donations to campaigns. If there is a real showing of corruption through these thirdparty groups they can be restricted as well in a manner consistent with Buckley.Citizens United doesnt create a new right to anonymously donate unlimited amounts of money These 527501c4 groups Dark Money groups have existed since before Citizens United. The case name escapes me right now in NAACP v Alabama ex rel Patterson 1958 the NAACP was once required to disclose its membership and their contributions. The NAACP argued that it shouldnt have to disclose its membership because theyd be subject to harassment  and the courts agreed. So you could always have groups that collect money for political campaigns but also dont have to disclose whos donating. PACs have always been able to set up these Dark Money groups. Citizens United doesnt create this ability. The caveat for these groups is that they 1 have to be nonprofit and 2 the justification is that their supporters would be subject to harassment. This works for the NAACP in the 1950s1960s. Should it work for Karl Rove today? Maybe not. But sometimes theres a valid reason for a group not to disclose its supporters. The trick is figuring out when that reason is valid.  I actually think the solution to this is some sort of incamera review by the federal courts. The distinction between the press and other speakers in that there really isnt one Freedom of the press is related to but distinct from freedom of speech. But it doesnt follow that other speakers somehow have less First Amendment protection than the press. The First Amendment protects all speakers regardless of structure or identity. Sure the press gets special mention but everyone else gets just as much protection as the press whether they are individual folks or in groups like corporations.  You can argue that companies like the New York Times are part of the free and open press and companies like ExxonMobil arent. But to me thats a distinction without a difference. ExxonMobils opinions can be just as valid as those of any press organizations. Why one corporation should be privileged over any other isnt clear to me. Or put another way this restriction isnt narrowly tailored enough. The distinction isnt also that meaningful when you consider that many corporations are small groups of people organized in nonprofit groups. The reason they organized is because they could pool resources and get their message heard. A blanket ban on corporate speech would silence these groups. Unless we carve out exemptions for them  but that just creates another loophole and were back to square one. This in turn is why banning corporate speech in the form of contributions probably wont fix the problem of corporate interests in politics. All a company would need to do is make a nonprofit that fits the profile of the above mentioned carve out.  The First Amendment generally doesnt care where speech comes from Assume you dont have a lot of money but are very passionate about your chosen candidate or position. The only thing that Citizens United recognized is that individual citizens sometimes with means and sometimes without can band together to support a candidate or a position.  Sometimes they can raise huge amounts of money to support their candidate or position. But because of Buckley these people cant give their money directly to the candidate of their choice. But what they can do is advocate their support on their own time on the behalf of the candidate or position they support. They can do this individually or in an organization like a nonprofit group or a corporation. Their First Amendment rights dont go away simply because they organized themselves into a group of a certain type. They can spend their own money to speak in support or opposition of a candidate either individually or as an organization.The government shouldnt be the gatekeeper to the marketplace of ideas Imagine you run a large multinational company. Your company the directors and some shareholders would prefer one candidate over another. You as the CEO would like to spend company funds to advocate a position. But some shareholders disagree and theres a real risk of alienating your customers.  Who should decide whether the company stakes a position here by spending money on ads in support of or in opposition to a candidate? The directors and shareholders? Or the government? How could the government handle this without infringing free speech? Remember that for the government to restrict speech it needs a compelling reason and the restriction needs to be narrowly tailored to achieve that end. Theres a completely understandable fear of the corrupting influence of big money in elections. Part of fixing the problem is understanding it fully in all its complex glory. It serves us all poorly to use issues like these to score political popularity points.   Election campaigns will always cost money and thats a sad fact of life.

Instead of actually trying to explain the complexity of the intersection between free speech and the fear of corruption the congressman is just playing us for political popularity points.The main rule with the First Amendment is that speech and the press may not be restricted unless theres a compelling government interest and that restriction is narrowly tailored to that interest. With that in mind lets plow on ahead.So heres what Citizens United is and isnt about in generalCitizens United isnt about corporate personhood Corporate personhood is utterly separate from the First Amendment. Corporations are juridical persons because 1 thats how they own property 2 thats how they get sued in court and 3 thats how we attach liability to them. Corporate personhood is just a neat legal fiction that has no First Amendment implications. Treating a corporation like a person is just a way to be able to attach duties and liabilities to a corporation. Corporations get due process rights not because of personhood but because due process is a structural protection. Its how our government is designed to act whenever it wants to take life liberty or property. If it helps think of due process as a limit on the state rather than an affirmative right given topossessed by individuals.  The same thing goes for the right to free speech. The First Amendment is a restriction on government action not an affirmative grant of a right. The right to free speech doesnt come from personhood it comes from Congress constitutional inability to abridge freedom of speech. The Framers realized that neutering the governments ability to act was a stronger protection than granting an affirmative right to the people. Thats why the First Amendment starts with Congress shall make no law rather than The people have a right to free speech. The distinction is subtle but it makes all the difference in the world.  The issue in Citizens United was really narrow. It was whether the statute that prohibited advocacy electioneering by thirdparty organizations 3060 days before an election infringed on free speech. The Supreme Court rightly I think found that it did.  All Citizens United does is recognize we have a really strong right to free speech in the United States that can only be restricted when theres a compelling interest and that the restriction is narrowly tailored to that interest. The 3060 day electioneering ban on thirdparty groups didnt fit the bill of being narrowly tailored to a compelling interest so it went out the door.Money is not and never has been pure speech. We also already regulate it Assume youre a person with a lot of money and you want to give a lot of it to your favorite candidate. Because of Buckley v. Valeo you cant give an unlimited amount of money directly to a candidate you like. Buckley recognized that theres a compelling interest in making sure candidates cant be swayed by big individual donors and upheld disclosure requirements as well as campaign contribution limits to candidates. Citizens United didnt change this. Its still illegal for an individual a company or any organization to give an unlimited amount of money to a candidate directly. Money is not and never has been pure speech under the complete protection of the First Amendment. If money was totally protected by the First Amendment antibribery laws couldnt exist because restricting bribes would be an abridgment of the right to free speech.  Money while not pure speech still falls under First Amendment protection. The reason we can regulate money though is because theres a a compelling interest  the fear of corruption or the appearance of corruption. This is why the Buckley court upheld campaign contribution limits to individual candidates and why the Citizens United court upheld mandatory disclosure provisions for PACs. These restrictions on free speech were narrowly tailored to the compelling interest of eliminating or avoiding corruption.  The Buckley corruption reasoning is also the implicit exception to Citizens United. The anticorruption rationale is enough to restrict individual donations to campaigns. If there is a real showing of corruption through these thirdparty groups they can be restricted as well in a manner consistent with Buckley.Citizens United doesnt create a new right to anonymously donate unlimited amounts of money These 527501c4 groups Dark Money groups have existed since before Citizens United. The case name escapes me right now in NAACP v Alabama ex rel Patterson 1958 the NAACP was once required to disclose its membership and their contributions. The NAACP argued that it shouldnt have to disclose its membership because theyd be subject to harassment  and the courts agreed. So you could always have groups that collect money for political campaigns but also dont have to disclose whos donating. PACs have always been able to set up these Dark Money groups. Citizens United doesnt create this ability. The caveat for these groups is that they 1 have to be nonprofit and 2 the justification is that their supporters would be subject to harassment. This works for the NAACP in the 1950s1960s. Should it work for Karl Rove today? Maybe not. But sometimes theres a valid reason for a group not to disclose its supporters. The trick is figuring out when that reason is valid.  I actually think the solution to this is some sort of incamera review by the federal courts. The distinction between the press and other speakers in that there really isnt one Freedom of the press is related to but distinct from freedom of speech. But it doesnt follow that other speakers somehow have less First Amendment protection than the press. The First Amendment protects all speakers regardless of structure or identity. Sure the press gets special mention but everyone else gets just as much protection as the press whether they are individual folks or in groups like corporations.  You can argue that companies like the New York Times are part of the free and open press and companies like ExxonMobil arent. But to me thats a distinction without a difference. ExxonMobils opinions can be just as valid as those of any press organizations. Why one corporation should be privileged over any other isnt clear to me. Or put another way this restriction isnt narrowly tailored enough. The distinction isnt also that meaningful when you consider that many corporations are small groups of people organized in nonprofit groups. The reason they organized is because they could pool resources and get their message heard. A blanket ban on corporate speech would silence these groups. Unless we carve out exemptions for them  but that just creates another loophole and were back to square one. This in turn is why banning corporate speech in the form of contributions probably wont fix the problem of corporate interests in politics. All a company would need to do is make a nonprofit that fits the profile of the above mentioned carve out.  The First Amendment generally doesnt care where speech comes from Assume you dont have a lot of money but are very passionate about your chosen candidate or position. The only thing that Citizens United recognized is that individual citizens sometimes with means and sometimes without can band together to support a candidate or a position.  Sometimes they can raise huge amounts of money to support their candidate or position. But because of Buckley these people cant give their money directly to the candidate of their choice. But what they can do is advocate their support on their own time on the behalf of the candidate or position they support. They can do this individually or in an organization like a nonprofit group or a corporation. Their First Amendment rights dont go away simply because they organized themselves into a group of a certain type. They can spend their own money to speak in support or opposition of a candidate either individually or as an organization.The government shouldnt be the gatekeeper to the marketplace of ideas Imagine you run a large multinational company. Your company the directors and some shareholders would prefer one candidate over another. You as the CEO would like to spend company funds to advocate a position. But some shareholders disagree and theres a real risk of alienating your customers.  Who should decide whether the company stakes a position here by spending money on ads in support of or in opposition to a candidate? The directors and shareholders? Or the government? How could the government handle this without infringing free speech? Remember that for the government to restrict speech it needs a compelling reason and the restriction needs to be narrowly tailored to achieve that end. Theres a completely understandable fear of the corrupting influence of big money in elections. Part of fixing the problem is understanding it fully in all its complex glory.

Hitler distinguished his economic program from the internationalist socialist program of state ownership of the means of production. Under Hitlers program the means of production would remain nominally private property however what the socalled owners could do with their property would be tightly regulated by the government the better to ensure that it was in service to the German people rather than selfish interests. Mises termed this socialism of the German variety since its fundamental aims are no different from more traditional socialism. He also used the term fascism to describe this economic program. Used in this sense it has nothing to do with goosestepping and Bellamy salutes.I believe its quite clear this is the sense in which the CEO of Whole Foods was using the term and he is absolutely correct. Granted what hes criticizing is not fullfledged fascism any more than most selfproclaimed socialist countries are fullfledged socialism but it does accurately describe a health care system that remains nominally private while being very heavily regulated.

[('t1_c7z4aa2', 'ModernDemagogue', '1358506426', 'Mike Masnick has a very narrow and shallow viewpoint on the topic of the value and scarcity of information which is pretty much in line with Aaron Swartz manifesto. Not once have I seen either of them defend this position adequately and he fails here as well. He often chooses straw men and slants his argument to fit his views. In critiquing the prosecutor he again is hard to take seriously and comes across as hollow and selfserving.He dismisses out of hand the Prosecutors valid point that there was a plea offer on the table and focuses on the oft repeated talking points like the 35 or later 50 years in prison possible dismisses the point that this never would have been the sentence without evidence or cause relying upon admitted anecdotal awareness of a couple instances of stiffer sentences to make unsubstantiated statements and basically fails to understand the way the justice system works ie the introduction of a superceding indictment which clarifies the theory of the crime allowing for multiple counts for the same offense which would not increase actual sentencing. He also has a lack of imagination and denies purpose and validity to the Prosecutors press release such as questioning why the prosecutor would trumpet the charges when issuing a statement in a press release not only might have a valid deterrent purpose and is completely separate from the actual legal dealings of the case but also does not even count as trumpeting.Aaron Swartz for all his accomplishments was a criminal he changed his MAC address and IP address in order to conceal his identity and access a network he had been prevented from accessing and to continue downloading files faster than security protocols allowed as well as override throttling and connection limits. This is very clearly hacking even if it was not all that complicated for any programmer with basic understanding of networks to pull off.Masnick does point out there may be a valid criticism of the justice department and the asymmetric power dynamics of plea bargains but Im not sure why Swartz would be the motivation for this discussion. This is the way its been for decades if not longer and while it is worth having the conversation it is simply not germaine to the issue of Swartz or whether this particular prosecutor singles Swartz out or drove him to suicide. Tears now over a common societal practice are disingenuine and selfserving. If you dont cry when others are harmed dont expect sympathy when one of yours is harmed.She did not single him out. This will not be popular but she did her job. We live in a society and there are laws. Sometimes laws go unenforced but that is almost always because society has an interest in letting someone has a pass. Sometimes there is an interest of justice which would suggest we should not label someone a felon or we should not prosecute an individual. I see no reason why that should apply here. Morality of luck often plays a role in such thoughts. Swartz was stopped so the harm was limited but had he not been stopped the harm might have been immeasurable and while the punishment for being stopped before doing something irreversible is more limited it is not to say that there should be no punishment no conviction. Furthermore Swartz seemed unlikely to have his view swayed and unlikely to stop performing such actions in the future. There in all likelihood would be future harm and a risk to society.Very simply our economy revolves around information having value and information being scarce. You can argue to the cows come home that this should not be the case that information should be freely available and shared and I might even agree with you.But until the day we no longer rely on converting information and the abstract tasks we perform to create it into physically scarce resources which make up food water shelter security information must have value.Both Masnick and Swartz put forward a theory of the value and scarcity of information which while it may function practically on the internet is completely incompatible with the dynamics and nature of the real world.

Theyd be swimming in wealth. The middle class would be healthier and have more wealth than ever before.Well that didnt happen. Every single cent that could be saved was sent straight to the top and paid out as bonuses or ridiculously inflated salaries to the handful at the top or paid out as dividends.The workers were the only ones who didnt enjoy the benefits of a more successful company. In fact quite the opposite. As companies grew larger and got the taste of blood ridiculous profits the companies in turn cut benefits and wages and froze hiring...because they realized that workers in a recession would work twice as hard for half as much if they had to in order to keep their jobs.The fallacy here is that politicians always say Nobody likes a recession. Nobody. Which is clearly not true because companies have been posting record profits for some time. Theyre getting very skilled labor in some cases for the same price they would pay them back in 1997. Maybe even before that in some industries.It really does create a type of wage slave who has no opportunity for a raise continues to lose benefits and pension opportunities...all the things that unions protected and demanded back whenever the labor movement took hold and created a thriving middle class that became the envy of the rest of the world.All that stuff is gone now because Americans stand alone. There is no union. There is one guy who is in debt to his eyes who is standing against a company worth billions who doesnt give a fuck about the worker. Because when the economy is bad there are hundreds lined up who will do the same job for less because they too are in heavy debt and running out of options.Theres a formula here if anyone would care to work it out and put it into historical context1. The busting of the labor unions who made sure benefits remained fair and strong demanded fair wages and high standards. Get rid of them and the rest is easy.2. Convince people who dont know any better that if the rich continue to get richer the middle class will thrive and enjoy and reap the rewards of all that money the wealthy gathers. More than 30 years later the republicans yes even the poor uneducated ones are demanding that it still works that way despite all the evidence to the contrary.3. Create a system of credit where every American can basically hang themselves in debt Use the banks and rig the system to create a recession where the ultra wealthy cannot lose either way. Watch the middle class slide off into poverty and watch those who still have a job go a far as humanly possible to keep that job. Working longer hours sometimes for less pay. Doing the work of 2 or 3 people by themselves after positions are eliminated. Cutting benefits raising the costs of healthcare benefits cutting vacation days eliminating sick days etc etc.Again...as long as Americans continue to go with this without making a peep they have make no mistake it will continue to get much much worse and wealth will continue to leave whats left of the middle class and find a new home with the wealthy.Thats how it was designed to work and thats how its working. And Americans seem perfectly happy with that.The funny thing is that we know what makes a strong middle class because fortunately at this point we have about 100 years of economy to explore and research and put together the pieces of the puzzle that created a strong middle class.Fortunately for the corporations Americans today seem very disinterested in history and economic context and seem perfectly happy allowing the wealthy to dictate how the economy will run as the middle class continues to slide off into the lower class.Americans have spoken loud and clear They absolutely do not mind working for lower wages and having no real future to speak of. That is the collective decision that most Americans have agreed to. I know it you know it and most certainly businesses and corporations know it.You think that the middle class was started because companies were kind and handed things like high wages and vacation days benefits overtime pay health care etc?Keep thinking that. Those things were all established and well established because Americans stood up together and demanded it. Back then they were smart enough to realize they were in control. They held the cards and they were the cogs in the system that allowed the company to profit at all. Those unions fought literally some died in making progress and building a middle class.This generation dont take offense its the truth handed all of those gains back to corporations and businesses on a silver platter without so much as a death rattle. Why wouldnt companies ask for it? No solidarity no strength no power of any kind. They basically kick workers around as they please until the worker gets sick of it and decides its better to be impoverished than to work their asses off 55 hours a week to barely make ends meet.No conspiracy theories here...this was all very much planned and well executed by the wealthy who controlled the strings. It worked like a charm and it will continue to work because Americans arent smart enough to stand together to demand more use their weight their strength and their anger to say We want better than were getting or you wont continue to make profits. Its that simple. Who said that? Union workers back in the day setting higher standards for wages and working conditions vacations days off overtime pay lunch breaks etc. If you think unions are outdated or are only for labor positions keep telling yourself that. I suppose thats much easier than actually learning how unions are applicable to any employment situation and that the strength drawn from unions is big enough to bring even the largest corporation to its knees if necessary. Otherwise enjoy your scraps and forget about the future. Where youre at now is as far as youll ever get most likely. Think about that for a minute because studies have shown that right now its more than likely true for most of you This is as good as its going to get financially if youre between the ages of 20 and 45. And oh yeah...you certainly will never be able to retire. Pensions and retiree benefits are a thing of the past. Why? The people who fought for those things and won them have either died off or are dying. Why give that shit to a bunch of whiny inconsequential workers who arent even smart enough to stand up for themselves? Corporations generally give you the least amount of pay and benefits as legally possible. They would most certainly give you less if they could. And believe me they try. Every day in DC they have lobbyists and special interests groups fighting against your interests and you have nobody fighting for you or your interests and that includes yourselves.Stand up organize and fight. Or sit down take the scraps youre handed and shut the fuck up. Those are literally your only two choices. And thats the truth.', 0.39573386), ('t1_c7w3nkn', 'Mogwell', '1358079431', 'But wait... theres moreTaking small steps towards a more historical contextAfter the Second World War the US which had been far less crippled by two successive world wars than its European allies  some might say it had done rather well  set the standard for economic productivity that other states aspired to in terms of GDP.By 2004 several European countries had caught up with the US. However the workers responsible for the productivity that the States had experienced did not get to enjoy the fruits of their labour in any real sense. Earnings remained stagnant for the general population and in terms of income the US is one of if not the most unequal societies in the developed world. Two other societies approaching the US in income inequality are Australia and the UK which also have a similar economic model.In comparison with France and the UK the share of income going to the top 110th of 1 of the US population remained relatively stable until the 1980s. At this point income shot up for the very wealthy in all three countries but most of all in the US the top 110th of 1 of the population took home 2 of total family income in France and the UK but 7 in the US in 98 and 03.Although average US income is still one of the highest in the world the difference between the wealthy and the poor is more pronounced than ever statistically speaking. What this has resulted in is likewise a larger gap than ever between those who can afford the best education and medical care and those who cannot. The result of this over time will be a classbased society.Some more statistics 2002Average salary rise 1970 to 1999 32522  35864 Average CEOs salary rise 1970 to 1999 1.3 million  37.7 million From 1979 to 1997 most of the extra money made by the the top 10 went to the top 1 and 60 of the extra income made by the top 1 went to the top 110th of 1.In 1970 the top 0.01 of taxpayers had 0.7 of total income. By 1998 this share had increased to 3. This means that by 98 the top 13000 wealthiest families in the US had as much income as the 20000000 poorest and made 300 times more than the average family. This trend has not really ceased since 98 with the result that money determines the politics of the US more than it ever has.Source Godfrey Hodgson The Myth of American Exceptionalism 2009EDIT I apologise for not listing more sources. The gist of the book I am quoting from is that the US is not as exceptional as it purports to be not that it is a bad country. If you find these statistics flawed or unappealing you need not accept them literally. The question to be answered is has the US become more economically unequal within the last 3040 years.

This database is expensive for universities to subscribe to but once they do most articles are available for free for people to use for research and other legitimate purposes. Some articles are individually very expensive if youre not at a subscribing university.He did it from a server closet in an MIT library and concealed his identity by registering the computer with a false name and false email address and then changed identifying elements of it so that every time it was banned from accessing the database he found a way around the block. This continued for a period of several weeks and then escalated for another month or two with him using better versions of scripts to download more and more files. To put this in perspective during November and December of 2010 he downloaded 100x as many files as the entire rest of the MIT campus. Not only did he download a lot of files but apparently both JSTOR and MIT repeatedly tried to stop him including surveilling him when he entered the computer closet and approaching him via campus police he ran.1.7 million of the articles werent actually owned by JSTOR but were licensed by independent publishers. Finally it is thought that he planned to release these articles for free either via bittorrent or some other mention though the proof or evidence of this is less clear to me. However I can sort of assume it to be true since he did the same thing with 19 million files from court cases though apparently this was legal since they were public domain and he has a history of being friendly with wikileaks and in favor of free information. It seems obvious to me what he wanted them for.Had he been successful he would have committed massive copyright infringement on a pretty unparalleled scale but since they caught him prior to the release of the files they charged him with a wide range of claims under the 1984 computer fraud and abuse act.The narrative described in the indictment is pretty absurd. If accurate he had to know what he was doing was wrong and not allowed and he did it anyway. He brought the prosecution on himself.Cumulatively the charges added up to 35 years in prison if convicted on all counts and forced to serve consecutively rather than concurrently which Im not an expert on but is pretty rare for a first time offender and there were pretty significant fines. Most of the blowback seems to be focusing on this worst case scenario number of 35 years being egregious but people get charged with hundreds of years all the time.Some people are also pointing out that MIT and JSTOR didnt want to press charges. Unfortunately that just isnt how it works. If someone commits a crime it is only up to the government whether charges are pressed and you they only decline at the request of a victim if they need that victims cooperation to convict. Also this neglects that there were lots of other victims in the form of the other publishers.Im sorry he felt he had to take his life but all my research into this did was indicate to me he wasnt even a particularly brilliant hacker. A brilliant hacker would never have gotten caught with the level of access he had. This was something anyone with basic knowledge of how networks work could pull off ie he had direct access to network switches and didnt even route the data from his laptop in the closet to another laptop elsewhere on campus so he wouldnt as easily be observed changing hard drives.Also theres this idea that because he took his own life we should now reflect on the prosecutions actions as excessive. To me that doesnt make any sense if you supported charging him before you still should. If you didnt you still dont but you dont get to claim ohh he killed himself. It is what it is but you dont make prosecutorial decisions based on whether the defendant is going to kill themselves.

I chose my words very carefully the swearing was quite deliberate.  I have made it my personal hobby horse to address the oft repeated but rarely challenged utter bullshit of that myth. 2nd of course you didnt get the idea from John Birch directly.  But let me ask you where did you get the idea?  Ill bet cash money your idea was not a conclusion at which you arrived after examining the relevant documents.  Ill bet cash money you never read the Federalist Papers or much detailed history of the times becuase if you had done that it would be clear to you that the idea is nonsense bullshit. Ill bet cash money you heard someone likely several someones say it and you went huh seems to make sense but you didnt bother to thoroughly examine the idea or even question it and have been repeating it ever since. Anyone who has actually thoroughly read the relevant documentation would respond to the claim with hahahahaha where the hell did you ever get THAT idea? 3rd I am saying the entire Constitution was crafted to prevent a tyrannical government. All of it the whole nine yards was drafted with precisely that intent. They designed a government with democratically elected representation with checks and balances with three equipotent branches with specified limits on the powers available to each branch and so on. The Framers set the whole thing up precisely and specifically to disallow the possibility of our government doing what King George had done to them. The protection against tyranny idea is reading the 2nd Amendment entirely out of context. You know what happens when you do that you can make all kinds of absurd and completely incorrect conclusions.  The only way to understand the 2ndA is to examine it in context. When one does so and additionally examines the circumstances and documentaton surrounding the creation of the context it becomes clear that protecting the people from government tyranny was never in their minds. The second amendment was specifically intended to give the government the means to suppress insurrection. I posted some other comments here with a link to another of my hobby horse comments that runs it down in some detail. You can also view my comment history for the last week or so for still more.  Im working on a single article with all that shit and more which i hope to have ready for tomorrows discussion posts but it might be too long  maybe Ill make a new blog and post it there or something.  4th it is good that you recognize that there are indeed limits on the weapons we may own.  You can find some good info on why we cant have Tommy guns or sawedoff shotguns in my other comments somewhere.  You can learn about the Gun Control Act of 1944 and the National Firearms Act of 1968 and the Miller and Heller SCOTUS decisions.  If you read the Heller decision pay special attention to the devastating for that judicial activist Scalia dissent The technology has changed dramtaically.  When the Constitutional Convention was doing their thing the technology was muskets.  Rifles were a new thing if they were even invented yet I know they were around by 1792 because one of the Militia Acts of 1792 specifically mentions rifles.  Repeating rifles semiautomatic weapons and machine guns were all unheard of.  gtwhy blame gunsThat is a straw man.  For one thing I didnt say anything anywhere in this thread nor elsewhere blaming guns for anything. You have assumed I am making an argument for banning guns or tight restrictions or something an argument I have never made.   Trust me I have owned and enjoyed using quite a few guns for over forty years I dont want to give them up nor am I a hypocrite.  It is a straw man because it implies that were i actually making the argument I am not in fact making I would be saying that its only guns to blame.  Thats exqctly the sort of simplistic reductionist nonsense that gets me using such fucking foul language.  Not tldr Any debate or discussion about gun laws about anything for that matter is a waste of time when some of the parties to the debate are underinformed misinformed make claims that are provably false place ideology above reality make unwarranted assumptions about the other sides intent focus on the other sides presumed motivations neglect to carefully define the subject and scope of the discussion et cetera.  All of which things are occurring in spades in the gun control brouha.  By both sides I might add.   The scare quotes are there because there arent two sides involved opinioms span the gamut from total abolition to no restrictions whatever.  Also because as I mentioned earlier people tend to come at it presupposing that there are two diametrically opposed sides which is disastrous for the discussion.

Although life expectancy and survival rates in the United States have improved dramatically over the past century Americans live shorter lives and experience more injuries and illnesses than people in other highincome countries. The U.S. health disadvantage cannot be attributed solely to the adverse health status of racial or ethnic minorities or poor people even highly advantaged Americans are in worse health than their counterparts in other peer countries.In light of the new and growing evidence about the U.S. health disadvantage the National Institutes of Health asked the National Research Council NRC and the Institute of Medicine IOM to convene a panel of experts to study the issue. The Panel on Understanding CrossNational Health Differences Among HighIncome Countries examined whether the U.S. health disadvantage exists across the life span considered potential explanations and assessed the larger implications of the findings.U.S. Health in International Perspective presents detailed evidence on the issue explores the possible explanations for the shorter and less healthy lives of Americans than those of people in comparable countries and recommends actions by both government and nongovernment agencies and organizations to address the U.S. health disadvantage.

Unfortunately he didnt discuss much of anything regarding states rights.gtDear creamgetthemoneyyThank you for taking the time to write to me with your desire to see the federal government respect state medical marijuana laws that provide patients with access to this drug. I appreciate you sending me the oped in the New York Times and I apologize for my delay in responding.The Department of Health and Human Services HHS has conducted numerous studies on the medicinal value of marijuana and every time finds that it has no medicinal value and should not be approved as safe or effective for the American people.In fact in the past I have offered an amendment to give the Food and Drug Administration FDA authority over medical marijuana. My amendment would have tasked the FDA with the responsibility to conduct any scientific studies deemed necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of medicinal marijuana. In lieu of my amendment it is my sincere belief that the District of Columbia and 18 states with medical marijuana laws are violating federal law by allowing patients to use a potentially harmful drug without FDAapproval.The body of evidence surrounding the dubious claims about medical marijuana is significant. In 2001 HHS completed an extensive analysis in response to a request to reschedule marijuana to a less restrictive schedule. After looking at all the relevant data on marijuana HHS concluded that the weight of the scientific evidence supported the findings that marijuana should continue to be a Schedule I substance because it has a high potential for abuse no currently accepted medical use in the United States and a lack of accepted evidence about the safety of using marijuana under medical supervision.While all of the longterm effects of marijuana use are not yet known there are studies showing serious physical and mental health concerns. The volume of literature detailing the harmful effects of whole smoked marijuana in fact continues to grow. Marijuana can be harmful in a number of ways through both immediate effects and damage to health over time. Marijuana hinders the users shortterm memory and may cause trouble for a user when handling complex tasks. With the use of more potent varieties of marijuana even simple tasks can be difficult. Because of the drugs effects on perceptions and reaction time users could be involved in auto crashes. Furthermore the immune system protects the body from many agents that cause disease. Both animal and human studies have shown that marijuana impairs the ability of Tcells in the lungs immune defense system to fight off some infections. Findings show that the regular use of marijuana or THC may play a role in cancer and problems in the respiratory and immune systems. Marijuana smoking could contribute to early development of head and neck cancer.In addition the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA has found that high doses of marijuana can induce psychosis disturbed perceptions and thoughts and marijuana use can worsen psychotic symptoms in people who have schizophrenia. There is also evidence of increased rates of depression anxiety and suicidal thinking in chronic marijuana users. According to the American Psychiatric Association Marijuana use may trigger panic attacks paranoia even psychoses especially if you are suffering from anxiety depression or having thinking problems.Furthermore I do not believe there is a medical application for smoking marijuana. In considering potential medical uses of marijuana it is important to distinguish between whole marijuana and pure tetrahydrocannabinol THC or other specific chemicals derived from cannabis. Whole marijuana contains hundreds of chemicals some of which are clearly harmful to health. As you may know the FDA has approved THC manufactured into a pill marinol that is taken by mouthnot smokedto treat the nausea and vomiting that go along with certain cancer treatments and is available by prescription. Another chemical related to THC nabilone has also been approved for treating cancer patients who suffer from nausea. Moreover the oral THC is also used to help AIDS patients eat more to maintain their weight.Despite anecdotal claims smoked marijuana has not been found to be safe and effective for treating any medical condition. The bottom line is marijuana is a dangerous addictive drug that poses significant health threats to users and society. Therefore I oppose any effort to legalize it support efforts to prevent marijuana abuse.Thank you again for writing me. I am very glad to have your opinions.

Despite spending more than twice as much as the rest of the industrialized nations 8160 per capita the United States performs poorly in comparison on major health indicators such as life expectancy infant mortality and immunization rates. Moreover the other advanced nations provide comprehensive coverage to their entire populations while the U.S. leaves 51 million completely uninsured and millions more inadequately covered.Health Profits CartoonThe reason we spend more and get less than the rest of the world is because we have a patchwork system of forprofit payers.

Trotsky believed that it wasnt necessary in underdeveloped countries he believed the transition could go from Aristocratic rule to Communist rule without the intermediate stage of a Bourgeois democracy. Post WWII Yugoslavia was more purely Socialist than Communist. For starters even though the state did own the economic industries the companies themselves were managed by workers collectives instead of the state. When their economy did transform into industry enterprises it was based off the investment of labor. Smaller companies did not have the same influence in decision making as the larger companies. Essentially it was each according to his deed not need. The largest reason that Yugoslavia prospered was because of Titos insistence on the NonAligned movement. Without Yugoslavia being internationally tied to the Western or Eastern blocs of power like other countries they were able to export their goods and services to both sides which did more for their economy than anything else.Lets not forget the most important note about Tito is that there was no real revolution to speak of. Following WWII he was voted in as Prime Minister even the Monarchists loyal to King Peter were allowed to vote. It was only after he was voted in that he and the Communists in Yugoslavia created a new constitution and the most likely reason he was voted in was because of his reputation of defending Yugoslavia during WWII. Yugoslavia was one of the few successful Communist countries because they were actually Socialists and Communist in name only. The fact that you speak of run a country in their way and speak of Communism only in certain countries is enough to make Trotsky jump out of his grave and spit in your face.

I have no doubt that it can work in a local capacity or  countries with small infrastructure but pretty much any system of governmenteconomics can given the right conditions. The drive of competition in a relatively free market is the biggest factor behind any production.

OK.. so let me explain.  The constitution is written and clearly states that the government formed by the constitution is in the form of a Republic.  It does not say we are a Democracy.  These are facts.  It says every state in the union must be a Republican state.  Which means that every state shall be just like the constitution says and use a Republic form of government.  Not a Democratic form of government.  People try and say were both democratic and republic... no.  There are similaritys like voting but thats it.  We the People does not mean 51 of the people.  The founders hated Democracy and wrote about.  Its takes 2 seconds  to look up hundreds of democracy quotes from the founders.  The guys that wrote the Constitution.  The constitution that says we are a Republic.  This is why we are failing today.  Democracy is slavery and leads to failure.  It leads to oligarchy fascism communism socialism.  In other words it leads to another form of government where the government is in charge of 100 percent of everything and the people are slaves.  We are heading or Id be bold enough to say we are already there as an Oligarchy. Nothing is different today then back in 1776 that would require us to not be a Republic.  In fact it would cure most the things that ail this country right now.  It would return us to the rule of law and politicians who wish to circumvent the constitution are treated as traitors not all mighty leaders and officials.  The only thing these leaders have led is the USA in debt and the demise of a once great nation.  Although all this happened before my time.  I was led to believe the same that we are a Democracy... boy was I surprised.  And I have to state that even though some people hate Republicans of today  the republicans of the once great and free Republic followed the constitution.  That time is long gone. We probably wont ever get back to that time unless people understand what a republic is what freedom really is and we would probably need another revolution to make it happen because those in charge now wont leave without a fight.  So it probably wont ever happen.  People love being willfully ignorant.  Even when people such as myself correct them or try to teach them the truth.  People dont like that.

Ask who the marines I looked up to were Ill tell you and so on that Im either legit or Ive studied the Marine Corps specifically so long as to be damn near the equivalent of a Marine.That brings us to homelessness.

I also understand that it is necessary to have some sort of catharsis over this kind of thing.

The discourse of the SRS board itself not necessarily that of its sisterboards  incredibly and entirely hateful.

Your title is implying that the tax rates at 91 caused the economy to prosper when the article says pretty much the opposite of that.gtUnfortunately the tax situation wasnt what it seemed. The illusion commences with that famous 1950s top rate of 91 percent. Official rates matter but so do effective rates the percent of income that people actually pay in tax. The Internal Revenue Service reckoned that the effective rate of tax in 1954 for top earners was actually 70 percent.gtOr lower. Marc Linder a law professor at the University of Iowa has shown that a more comprehensive interpretation of income that includes capital gains suggests the real effective tax rate for millionaires was 49 percent in 1953. The effective rate dropped throughout the decade reaching 31 percent by 1960. That 31 percent is just slightly higher than the 29 percent level a Congressional Budget Office report figures the average effective tax for the top quintile will be in 2014. And that number for 2014 doesnt include taxes in Obamas healthcare law.gtEven Eisenhower pushed for a reduction in dividend taxes though he succeeded only modestly. The prospect of lower taxes encouraged growth. Today by contrast whether they apply to dividends or income taxes are set in the up direction. The only debate as we saw this week was by how much and when.gtThe only competition it confronted after all was from Europe still recovering from World War II or the U.K. whose tax regime was even more confiscatory than our own. Now however the U.S. must compete. And this is where the U.S. with some of the worlds highest corporate taxes flunks.gtThe political dynamic of the 1950s is traced by Thorndike in a paper he wrote for New York University Law School and the Bush Institute where I work. The high tax rates of the 1950s represented a compromise of sorts Thorndike writes between those who wanted to soak the rich in the name of fairness and those who sought to float all boats with a rising tide of economic growth. When we recall the eras sky high statutory rates we are remembering only half the story.So....article gets posted saying that there is a huge misunderstanding of the 1950s tax rates points out how different it is from today yet the comments here are filled with people saying this proves Republicans wrong.Nobody fucking reads articles anymore.

In general in New York if you resist arrest you will be harmed and might end up dead. I would not recommend trying it.Only 12 States currently allow forcible resistance to unlawful arrest. New York State is not one of them. This is not a constitutional issue unless it escalates to the level of deprivation of life. And if you are the one that escalates from reasonable force to deadly force youre not going to get any sympathy.gtThe licensing process isnt intrusive its not expensive and its not complicated whatsoever.Here is the process httpwww.nyc.govhtmlnypdhtmlpermitshandgunlicensingapplication.shtmlIt costs 450 it requires revealing expunged or sealed convictions as well as even minor summons or any nonmoving violation infraction.

But nevermind you keep on voting for the same people that preach the same completely backwards broken hopeless economic nonsense term after term and wonder why the budget hole is still there.And education? Jesus christ dont even get me started on that shit. You have the worst schools in the entire fucking country. Your public education system is a complete failure. You cant train your kids worth a damn. If it wasnt the rest of the US economy dragging your asses along your isolated workforce would destroy itself within a decade. This is also why crime rates are through the roof in your state. Meanwhile NRA likes to keep claiming that gun ownership prevents crime. Texas has one of the highest percapita gun ownership in the country. How does that work out for you guys?No matter I know exactly what youre going to say in response. You think because Texas has oil reserves it could support itself very well if it wasnt for the federal government messing about with your natural resources. Except thats complete bullshit too. This isnt how oil drillingrefining works. Canada is the 2nd largest oil producer in the world after OPEC Organization of Petrol Exporting Countries if youre unfamiliar. If you want a comparison Canada has about 150 billion barrels of oil in proven reserves while OPEC is sitting on about 1.2 trillion barrels. Its estimated that they hold about 70 of all global reserves. Do you know what this implies? It means that OPEC has the ability to adjust their oil production out put limitlessly based on what everyone else produces. If Canada decides to produce more oil in an effort to reduce oil prices OPEC has the ability to reduce their own production by a matching amount and hence keeping oil prices exactly where they want it to be. This is the reason why oil prices in Canada have been rising and falling with the exact same pattern that prices in the US have been. OPEC controls oil prices and theres very little we can do about it except reduce oil dependency in general and hence force the prices down by reducing demand. Which is to say that unless Texas nationalizes the oil reserves kicks out every oil company and has its government drill refine and distribute oil on its own its still subject to global oil prices. You might wonder whats the big deal lets isolate our economy Good fucking luck doing that. Oil byproducts are in everything plastic hellooooo and you cant isolate your oil industry without fucking up the rest of your economy.You Texans need to really realize that your state is in complete shitter and it will stay there until you stop electing these rightwing lunatics who dont fucking understand how economics work on any scale.

Even a person seeing your gun in a lot of states is grounds for a brandishing arrest. And let me be clear thats the way it should be. If youre carrying you better be the most polite motherfucker around. Someone steals your spot in the parking lot deal with it. CCW is to protect you and only you plus your family in most states and youre still going to get arrested most of the time and have to defend yourself in court its not like the cops just say oh nice work. There is no reason that should I be cornered the only people armed are the ones that want to hurt me and dont care about the law.
